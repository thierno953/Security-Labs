## Executive Summary

A phishing email impersonating MetaMask targeted a business inbox, warning of an "unrecognized login attempt" and urging the user to click a link to verify activity. The email used Unicode homoglyph obfuscation and a URL shortener, typical techniques to bypass detection. Clicking the link could lead to wallet credential theft.
